# Abstract
Overall, we have come to the conclusion that between three metrics measuring safety, least crime rates, least number of 311 calls, and least amount of COVID-19 cases, that Mount Oliver is the safest neighborhood to move to. Furthermore, Mount Oliver may also be the best neighborhood, depending on how important safety may be to a homeowner or resident within a neighborhood or municipality. For many, safety is the top priority, which makes Mount Oliver the best neighborhood to move to. We have come to this conclusion utilizing datasets, graphics, and three metrics mentioned above. We are confident that Mount Oliver is the best neighborhood, on based these three metrics.
